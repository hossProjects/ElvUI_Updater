# ElvUI_Updater
Powershell script to update ElvUI

# DESCRIPTION

This powershell script was created to automate the process of downloading and extracting the lastest ElvUI addon.
It assumes you already have World of Warcraft Classic installed.

Future developement includes an option to create user task, in task scheduler, for daily checks.
This option has been left out until enoug interest is shown to support it.

# INSTALLATION

Download the ps1 file and run from any location.
It will determine if ElvUI needs to be installed or updated.

Additionally, it will backup any "*ElvUI*" folders to the WOW install drive prior to updating.
This allows the user to roll back an update if needed.
